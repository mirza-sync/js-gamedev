# JS Gamedev

> Every gamer ever dreamt of become a game developer once.

I wanted to try something new. Stumbled on this course on freeCodeCamp. It's a 9 hour course of making a 2D side-scrolling game. And did he say mobile? I'm in! XD

Looking towards understanding game physics, animation rendering, and also improving my vanilla javascript skillz.
