# JS Gamedev

> Every gamer ever dreamt to become a game developer once.

I wanted to try something new. Stumbled on this course on freeCodeCamp. It's a 9 hour course of making a 2D side-scrolling game. And did he say mobile? I'm in! XD

Looking towards understanding game physics, animation rendering, and also improving my vanilla javascript skillz.

## Dev Logs

1. I knew what is sprite. But sprite sheet? It's a whole new thing. Didn't expect that game developer uses this thing to animate their sprites. I thought that each animation frame contained in multiple files lol. The idea to preload a sprite sheet to reduce the number of images loaded to memory to improve performance was so cool.

2. **7th Apr 2024:** Finished the first part of the course: Sprite Animation Technique.
   - Learn't about showing cropped part of the sprite sheet and rendering them on every frames to create an animation. Sweet.
   - Haven't done DOM manipulation for years. The last time I did was in my university project, during the jQuery era. This is so nostalgic hahaha.
