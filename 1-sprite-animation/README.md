# Topic 1: Sprite Animation

> Judging my vanilla JS skill; one frame at a time.

## Dev Logs

1. I knew what is sprite. But sprite sheet? It's a whole new thing. Didn't expect that game developer uses this thing to animate their sprites. I thought that each animation frame contained in multiple files lol. The idea to preload a sprite sheet to reduce the number of images loaded to memory to improve performance was so cool.

2. **7th Apr 2024:** Finished the first part of the course: Sprite Animation Technique.
   - Learn't about showing cropped part of the sprite sheet and rendering them on every frames to create an animation. Sweet.
   - Haven't done DOM manipulation for years. The last time I did was in my university project, during the jQuery era. This is so nostalgic hahaha.
